    Our findings, exemplified by hydrophobicity data in the shadowed regions above, show that visualization design significantly 
    impacts viewersâ€™ abilities to read data encoded on a surface. (a, b) Ambient occlusion surfaces support viewers in reading shadowed
    data, which is improved by (c) directional shading.

This project led us to ask and run empirical studies to see how perception of lightness constancy comes into play when displaying data using color on surfaces (such as [molecular surfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/proteins.md %})) that use shading to convey a sense of three-dimensional shape. 

Our work uses a sequential series of experiments to test the presence of lightness constancy, the effect of structural information, approximation of shadow darkening, the effect of luminance-encoded color ramps, and addition of optional shape cues (stereoscopic and suggestive contours). We provide a series of conclusions about supporting color constancy to ensure viewers obtain accurate judgments of shadowed data in computer-generated visualizations.
